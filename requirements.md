## Project requirements
These requirements are here to provide a framework. If you think you need an exception to something here (ie: you want to use fewer conditionals), be sure to get it approved in advance. Be prepared to provide additonal skills you will show instead.

**Your code should include:**
* Comments
* imported and referenced package 
  * random, math, or csv are recommended
* Variables
* If-elif-else
  * At least 2 that contain 1 or more `elif` statements
* Loops
  * For loops (2 different uses)
  * While loops (2 different uses)
* Functions
  * At least 3 that do more than just print
  * At least 2 must be called multiple times
* Dictionary OR File handling
* Error handling
  * Program does not crash with bad input
  * At least 1 try/except must be used
  * Other methods of error handling may be used in additon to the try/except
* Good style (order, spacing, etc)
  * Questions? Ask Megan, follow PyCharm's suggestions, or look [here](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).
  
**Non-code elements**  
* Proposal and schedule (in [README.md](README.md))
* [Pseudocode](pseudocode.md)
* Update README with title and description
* Presentation (12/15 - last day of class)
